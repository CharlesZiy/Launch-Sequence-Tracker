# Launch Sequence Tracker

## Brief Introduction

The program is a Python-based timer to track the events of a rocket during launch.

The developer is in middle school and has limited time for development and maintenance.

Major development work will take place on and after April 26.

Demo version will be ready and released by May 3 (Before CZ-5 Y8 / Chang'E 6 Mission).

## Planned Function:
- $T_0$ countdown based on given $T_0$;
- Flight events (e.g. *Fairing Jettison*) countdown based on predictive flight sequence;
- Flight phase display (e.g. *Orbit Insertion*) based on predictive flight sequence;
- Mission briefing display (with background image).

## Current Develop Progress:
|Issue / Function|Status|
|:-:|:-:|
|Data Collection|Partly Done|
|Basic GUI Develop|Partly Done|
|Timer Design|Partly Done|
|Interface Beautification|Only Idea|
|Multi-Language Support|Only Idea|

The recent demo versions will be **mainly** in Chinese, and English adaptation **will be considered** later.
